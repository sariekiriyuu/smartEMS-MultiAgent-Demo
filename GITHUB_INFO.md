# GitHub Repository Information

## Repository Name
```
smartEMS-MultiAgent-Demo
```

## Repository Description (Short)
```
Multi-AI Agent Energy Management System with HILS simulation, Hybrid AI (ML+LLM), and MCP Runtime - Real-time visualization demo for smart grid optimization
```

## Repository Description (Detailed)
```
A demonstration platform showcasing advanced energy management technologies through Hardware-in-the-Loop Simulation (HILS), Multi-Agent Collaboration, and Hybrid AI architecture. Features 6 specialized AI agents (Forecaster, Optimizer, Scheduler, Fault Detection, Orchestrator, HILS Coach) working together via Model Context Protocol (MCP) to optimize ESS/PV/Load management. Built with Python, Streamlit, and real-time visualization using Plotly.
